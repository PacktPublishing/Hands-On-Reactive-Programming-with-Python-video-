# Hands-On Reactive Programming with Python [Video]
This is the code repository for [Hands-On Reactive Programming with Python [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/hands-reactive-programming-python-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781789138795), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Reactive Programming makes things easier by adding a toolbox of operators to filter, create, transform, and unify any of those observable streams. In just a few lines of maintainable code, we can have web sockets that receive multiple requests and handle them on an asynchronous process that serves a filtered output.

This practical guide will take you steadily through an exploration of Reactive Programming. In this course, you will learn about Reactive Programming in Python using RxPY and simplify the way you write code and create robust enterprise applications. The course covers the major libraries on Python reactive extensions (RxPY) and explains in detail the role of asynchronous programming and event-based programming in building reactive extensions. You will look deep into its provided classes, methods, and operators, to help you to build a reactive application. 

By the end of the course, you will be equipped to solve real-world problems and have a clear understanding of when and how you should use the different approaches demonstrated in RxPY.
